company id: company id in this dataset
ticker/cusip/sedol: company ticker/cusip/sedol
prod id: tradename/product id in this dataset
prod name: tradename/product name
prod.active: Flag for whether the record is currently active. In general, Y means that the tradename/product is currently marketed by the company and N means that the tradename/product has been discontinued. However, while the same tradename/product will usually have only one record for its entire lifetime, on occasion the entity may change so significantly that a new tradename/product record will be created and the old record deactivated, even though they have the same name and/or associated company.
